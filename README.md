Wikipedia began as a side project of Nupedia in the form of a free online encyclopedia whose articles were written by experts.[7] Larry Sanger, who founded Nupedia with Jimmy Wales, floated the idea of ​​a wiki-based encyclopedia on January 10, 2001 on the Nupedia mailing list.[8] Then on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia was officially launched on the website www.wikipedia.com.
